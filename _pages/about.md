Bonjour! I am a :mortar_board: **MSc Student** in Computer Science at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and University of Montreal. I work on robot learning at [Robotics and Embodied AI Lab](https://montrealrobotics.ca/) under supervision of [Prof. Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/). 
My current reserach vision is to leverage bayesian deep learning methods for robotics as to make a probabilistic deep robotics stack.    

Before joining as Master's student, I was an intern for a year under Prof. Liam Paull. Before that I was undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur, where I spent all of my time
at [AGV](http://www.agv.iitkgp.ac.in/) under supervision of Prof. Debashish Chakravarty working on perception and embbeded-control systems for autonomous vehicles.

I am a avid chess player (not professionally).
