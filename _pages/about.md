Namaste! Bonjour! I am currently an AI resident at Meta AI (FAIR) working with [Brandon Amos](http://bamos.github.io/), [Ricky Chen](rtqichen.github.io) and [Mustafa Mukadam](https://www.mustafamukadam.com/). Currently my current research vision is to enable RL agents to generalize across tasks on the same system without re-training for each tasks individually. Before this, I was a :mortar_board: **MSc Student** in Computer Science at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and University of Montreal where I worked on robot learning at [Robotics and Embodied AI Lab](https://montrealrobotics.ca/) under supervision of [Prof. Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/). 
    

Before joining as Master's student, I was an intern for a year under Prof. Liam Paull. Before that I was undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur, where I spent all of my time
at [AGV](http://www.agv.iitkgp.ac.in/) under supervision of Prof. Debashish Chakravarty working on perception and embbeded-control systems for autonomous vehicles.

I am a avid chess and badminton player (not professionally).
